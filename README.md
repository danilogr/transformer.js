# transformer.js
A JavaScript library for 3d transformations

## Motivation
While working on a zoomable drawing canvas for mobile and desktop use, I figured out that it was incredibly difficult to find a web library that—out-of-the-box—supports panning, scaling, and rotation of HTML and SVG elements. The few libraries that I found did not really fulfill all requirements, which are basic 2d transformations of visual elements in arbitrary nested hierarchies. Therefore, I found myself spending time on implementing transformer.js to exactly meet my requirements. Maybe this will be useful for someone else, which is why I want to share it with the public as open source project.

# Download
The library cna be found under [release](https://github.com/raedle/transformer.js/releases) in this GitHub project.
